We can only call BitCoin as an online Wallet store. </p>
          <br>

Anyone can use bitcoin like we all use the internet and so does anyone. The owner is not the same as in bitcoin.

If you have bitcoin, you can convert it to your country's currency and transfer it to the bank account. Bitcoin has become the most expensive currency in the world.

          <br>
          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b> 1. </b> If you have money, then you can buy bitcoins by paying directly, if you do not have that much money but still you have to take bitcoins, then there is a way if you do not buy the whole bitcoin. If you can, you can buy its smallest unit like 100 rupees in one rupee, in the same way there are 10 crores satoshi in one bitcoin, then you can buy small amount of bitcoin satoshi slowly one or more bitcoin You can make deposits when you have more bitcoins deposited, then you can earn more money by selling it, by buying bitcoins in a way, you can invest in it.

Minors complete transactions in various ways using special types of computers and secure the network.

Bitcoin mining can be done by anyone. It requires a computer with high speed prosessor. Mining is done by people who have special calculating computers and the ability to do big calculations. </p>
